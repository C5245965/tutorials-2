1. Log on to your [HANA Cloud Platform account](https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com/cockpit), click on the **Services** tab, click on  the **Development & Operations** tile. On the **Development & Operations** status page, click the **Go to Service** link to open the Development & Operations cockpit.

What we offer in this part is not more than a basic recipe to set up a minimum installation including only those components on Linux that we consider as absolutely necessary to run a CI/CD process for development with SAP. However, the setup best suited to your concrete requirements cannot be part of this document because it highly depends on your concrete local situation, the network setup, the overall landscape into which the CI/CD process will be embedded, and so on. Therefore, we will restrict ourselves here to showing only the principles and the core elements.

If you are interested in other examples of CI/CD processes with a focus on specific needs and local conditions, just follow the references we provide to the official documentation for the described components. For each component, we provide hints to how the described setup could be improved. This concerns the professional and reliable operation, for example, further security activities and operational refinements.
